  <p>Soldering is an indispensable skill for countless fields of
interest, from electric luthierie to car repair. While I am
not a master at soldering, I hope by sharing what I have
learned I may help beginners struggling to solder clean
joints.</p>
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>
<p>Soldering can be a dangerous activity. There are high
temperatures and toxic fumes involved, but with proper
precautions, most health risks can be minimized.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I am not a medical expert and take no
liability for any injuries you may sustain from following
(or not following) these safety tips.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ventilate your workspace. Rosin flux fumes can cause
occupational asthma<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware of residual lead on your hands. Do not eat and
drink while soldering, and wash your hands afterwards.
Failing to do so can result in accidental ingestion of
lead. Note that even thorough hand-washing is not
completely effective at removing lead<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear eye protection. Solder can &lsquo;spit&rsquo;, flinging molten
tin into the air<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not the entire extent of all the safety precautions
you should follow! Be sure to conduct further research about
how to keep yourself safe while soldering. Additionally,
further safety tips throughout the post will be in <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<p>With that out of the way&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="iron">Iron</h2>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a fancy, expensive soldering station to make
clean joints. I personally use a $10 soldering iron (which
included tips and solder!).</p>
<h2 id="solder">Solder</h2>
<p>You have two main choices for solders: leaded (SnPb) and
unleaded (RoHS).</p>
<p>There is quite a debate about the health effects of both
options. The general consensus is that <strong>unleaded solder is
safer than leaded solder</strong><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Although some
proponents of leaded solder say otherwise, I have not found
a reputable source to verify these claims.</p>
<p>Note that with both leaded and unleaded solder, the
<strong>primary hazard is flux fumes, not metal fumes</strong>. The
temperatures involved in soldering are not high enough to
vaporize the metal constituents<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Leaded solder is a lot easier to work with than unleaded
solder&mdash;it melts at lower temperatures, flows better, and
solidifies into stronger joints. Additionally, RoHS solders
composed of pure tin can form whiskers, thin filaments
of tin which can cause shorts between joints. Leaded solder
is also easier on your wallet; alternative metals used in
RoHS solders are typically much more expensive than lead.</p>
<p>Personally, I use 60% tin, 40% lead solder. It&rsquo;s the only
composition of leaded solder I&rsquo;ve used. I&rsquo;ve found no
problems with it so far, so why switch?</p>
<h2 id="cleaning">Cleaning</h2>
<p>You should clean and tin your iron every few joins you
solder. There are two main cleaning options available: a
good ol&rsquo; damp sponge, or a fancy wire coil cleaner.</p>
<p>I use a sponge; they&rsquo;re cheap and simple. They do have the
unfortunate side effect of sucking heat from your iron. If
you notice your soldering iron is making cold joints after
cleaning your tip, try turning up the temperature.</p>
<p>Some claim there is a <strong>risk of inhaling lead solder dust
when using a wire soldering iron cleaner</strong><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> as
pictured below.</p>
<p><img src="wire-cleaner.jpg" alt="Wire coil soldering iron cleaner"></p>
<h2 id="flux">Flux</h2>
<p>Do not be misled; although solder wire may advertise a rosin
flux core, it is an inadequate amount to facilitate easy
flow onto a joint. Rosin core in solder wire only promotes
adhesion to the iron itself&mdash;additional flux is required
for solder to flow smoothly on a joint.</p>
<p>I strongly endorse tacky no-clean gel flux. It is typically
sold in syringes for easy application, which is appropriate,
as you should apply it liberally and often to your joints.</p>
<p><img src="flux.jpg" alt="Gel flux in a syringe"></p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<p>Before even turning on the iron, you need to pick a suitable
tip. The best tip is usually the biggest one you can
manipulate deftly within your workspace. Flat ends or curves
on a tip create a large surface area to transfer heat with,
which helps heat a joint more quickly.</p>
<p>I use a large double-flat tip with a blunted point, so I
have three flat surfaces to transfer heat with. It looks a
little like this:</p>
<p><img src="double-flat.jpg" alt="A double-flat soldering iron tip with a bluntedpoint"></p>
<p>If you opt to use a smaller tip, you may have to turn up
your irons temperature to hasten heat transfer.</p>
<h2 id="tinning">Tinning</h2>
<p>Tinning is the process of melting solder against the tip of
an iron. It helps protect the iron from oxidation, which
reduces thermal conductivity of the iron and prevents solder
from sticking to the tip. Always make sure to tin your tip
before first use and before turning off your iron.</p>
<h2 id="temperature">Temperature</h2>
<p>When I first started soldering, I made the mistake of
thinking that the hotter my iron was, the easier soldering
would be.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true solder will melt faster, a hotter iron also
leads to faster oxidation of tips, overheated joints, and
possible damage of nearby components (usually plastics) from
radiant heat. <strong>Melting plastics (and other materials) can
release toxic fumes.</strong> Try to keep the iron temperatures under
450 degrees Celsius to prevent this<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I typically set my iron to 250&ndash;300 degrees Celsius. It&rsquo;s
more than hot enough to melt leaded solder, and just hot enough
to melt unleaded solder&mdash;but not so hot that it starts to
melt nearby plastics.</p>
<p>After you turn on your iron, let it sit for a few minutes
(under a watchful eye, of course) to fully heat up.</p>
<h2 id="know-when-to-foldem">Know When to Fold&rsquo;em</h2>
<p>A soldering iron won&rsquo;t always work for your project. For
example, you might be able to get away with soldering a chip
onto a motherboard with a soldering iron, but to desolder
chips cleanly without bending any pins, you&rsquo;ll need to use a
heat gun. I&rsquo;ve had the (mis?)fortune of learning this from
experience&hellip;</p>
<p>Sometimes, you might have to swallow your ego and admit you
aren&rsquo;t skilled enough for an exceptionally difficult job.
There&rsquo;s less shame in conceding you don&rsquo;t know how to do
something right at the moment than doing it wrong and
breaking something.</p>
