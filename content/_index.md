# Hi, I'm Sawyer

I'm a student currently pursuing cybersecurity as my major.
Computer science and security have always been passions of
mine. I also love playing and listening to music---I play
all sorts of instruments, including guitar, banjo, cajon,
keyboard, and bass guitar. Alternative rock and grunge are
my favorite genres. More recently, I've become interested in
backpacking.

This is a place for me to write about my hobbies and
projects. I post infrequently---usually about every two
months.

A few of my friends have cool blogs you should check out as
well:

* [Wizardwatch](https://www.wizardwatch.net/): Mostly NixOS,
  few posts right now
* [Biotech Blog](https://biotechblog.org/):  Really cool
  biotechnology stuff!
