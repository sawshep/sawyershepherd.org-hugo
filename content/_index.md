# Hi, I'm Sawyer

I'm a cybersecurity student at the University of North
Georgia, and the president of UNG's cybersecurity club,
the CyberHawks. Cybersecurity have always been a
passion of mine. I also love playing music---I play all
sorts of instruments, but mainly I play fiddle in a string band.

This is a place for me to write about my projects and
hobbies. I post infrequently. Everything on here is my opinion!

A few of my friends have blogs you should check out as well.

* [Biotech Blog](https://biotechblog.org/):  Really cool
  biotechnology stuff!
* [Crypticsignals](https://crypticsignals.github.io/):
  Fellow CyberHawks blue-teamer posting about cybersecurity.
* [JackTheSparrow](https://jackthesparow.github.io/):  CTF
  writeups, and a fellow CyberHawk as well.
* [Daniel Pham](https://danielphms.github.io/blogs.html):
  Personal blog featuring tennis and homelab content.
