# Hi, I'm Sawyer

I'm a Cybersecurity student at the University of North
Georgia. I'm a member of the UNG CyberHawks Advanced
Competitve Red Team, and a team lead of the UNG CyberUnit
3rd Element. Computer science and security have always been
passions of mine. I also love playing and listening to
music---I play all sorts of instruments, including guitar,
banjo, cajon, keyboard, and bass guitar.

This is a place for me to write about my project and
hobbies. I post infrequently---usually about every two
months. Everything on here is my opinion!

A few of my friends have blogs you should check out as well.
Their opinions are not necessarily mine.
